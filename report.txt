1. I will be comparing the first and last books of the Dune original series; Dune (1965) by Frank Herbert and Sandworms of Dune(2007) by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson. Frank Herbert died before the series was finished and the following two books were written by his son Brian and fellow science fiction author Kevin Anderson. The posthumous books were written based on Frank Herbert's notes. Many fans were dissatisfied by B. Herbert and Anderson's work, which poses the question of what major differences are there between the writings of Frank and his successors?

To get the actual text needed for the analysis I obtained a pdf with recognized text of each book. For Dune I was able to run a python script to scrape the text using PyPDF2. Sandworms of Dune was formatted in a way which made automated scraping with the earlier technique impossible and so after a time/benefit analysis I copied and pasted it manually rather than developing a new script. Both books were trimmed of everything except the central story, meaning for example that the appendixes are not included. Pre-chapter headings were saved however.
